/**
 * The gateway speaks the OpenAI chat-completions protocol but streams
 * thinking via `delta.reasoning_content`, which @ai-sdk/openai's chat
 * completions path never parses. `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` (the same
 * provider aime-chat uses for custom endpoints) maps both `reasoning_content`
 * and `reasoning` deltas onto AI SDK reasoning parts, so streamed thinking
 * works out of the box for any OpenAI-compatible model we attach later.
 *
 * The gateway also rejects OpenAI's reasoning-model conventions such as the
 * `developer` system role, so the SDK's forceReasoning provider option cannot
 * be used. Qwen toggles thinking natively via `enable_thinking`, injected at
 * the transport layer so each runtime profile gets the right behavior without
 * forking the SDK.
 *
 * Reasoning effort (off/low/medium/high) rides the same transport injection:
 * `enable_thinking` gates thinking entirely and `reasoning_effort` selects the
 * depth for providers that support it (ignored elsewhere, matching how the
 * OpenAI-compatible ecosystem treats unknown body fields).
 *
 * Base URL / API key / model id are resolved per request-epoch from the
 * saved provider configuration (same idea as aime-chat's ProvidersManager):
 * an explicit selection from the chat prompt input wins, otherwise the first
 * enabled model of the first active provider. .env is never consulted for
 * models.
